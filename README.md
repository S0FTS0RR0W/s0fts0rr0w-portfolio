## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/s0fts0rr0w/s0fts0rr0w-portfolio.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and allow you to customize the build process.

## Deployment

After running `npm run build`, the optimized production-ready files will be located in the `build` directory. You can deploy these static files to any static hosting service.

For local testing of the production build, you can use a package like `serve`:

1.  Install `serve` globally (if you haven't already):
    ```sh
    npm install -g serve
    ```
2.  Navigate to your project's root directory and run:
    ```sh
    serve -s build
    ```
    This will serve your built application from the `build` directory.
